## Overview

The DataShaka Core API is a REST API with a Query and Response model. The response is standard HTTP, so constitutes a stream of data. As a REST API the functionally is described in terms of routes (queries with parameters that will either be GET or POST) and responses that are in the form of streamed documents.
